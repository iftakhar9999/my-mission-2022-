                there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it, continue. If
                you don’t like it, Google it or search on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn.
                Once you have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to learn. So,
                don’t try to fit hard on other’s way, instead, build your own way to learn.

                Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a
                little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after
                a while.
